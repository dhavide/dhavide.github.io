  <h2 id="a-note-to-our-community-on-building-trust">A note to our community on building trust</h2>
  
<p>In case you don’t know, <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/note-to-our-community"><em>DataCamp recently published a statement</em></a> concerning a senior executive—who is <em>still</em> with the company—sexually assaulting an employee—who is <em>not</em> (more details at the bottom of this post). The former employee has bravely come forward, so I wish to share the following two facts:</p>
<p>1. <strong>I disclosed to my manager on June 12th, 2018 my concerns about DataCamp’s internal handling of the sexual assault; DataCamp fired me three days later. My colleague Greg Wilson (who had expressed similar sentiments) was fired the same day</strong> (see <a href="http://third-bit.com/2019/04/05/the-worst-behavior.html"><em>http://third-bit.com/2019/04/05/the-worst-behavior.html</em></a> for his thoughts).</p>
<ul>
<li>As of June 2018, to the best of my knowledge, the assailant's punishment was a single day's sensitivity training &amp; an imposed limit on his alcohol consumption at company functions.</li>
<li>I criticized two precedents being established internally: that DataCamp doesn't take sexual assault seriously, and worse, that illegal behavior is acceptable from employees of sufficiently high rank.</li>
<li>DataCamp first tried to poach me from my prior job in June 2017 and continued until I started at DataCamp in April 2018. My employment there lasted less than 75 days—before a quarterly performance review was possible (and an improvement plan established as is standard HR practice).</li>
<li>In spite of my being fired "for performance", the 5 courses I supervised/appeared in remain at the core of DataCamp’s Python curriculum; they have been completed by nearly a quarter of a million people since 2017 (DataCamp's public-facing numbers).</li>
</ul>
<p>2. <strong>Upon termination, DataCamp offered me money to sign a non-disparagement agreement to restrict my speaking publicly or privately about the company and its officers. I declined to accept these conditions &amp; any according compensation.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The letter of separation included the NDA as well as a release of my future rights to sue.</li>
</ul>
<p>DataCamp refutes any connection between my complaint and the terminations three days later. They also assert (about the sexual assault incident):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The incident was antithetical to both the true culture of our company as well as our belief of the personal ethics and integrity of the executive in question.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I cannot know their intentions, but, in my opinion, all their actions—those shortly after Oct. 2017, those I witnessed as an employee between April &amp; June 2018, and those from the last two weeks—are inconsistent with both of those claims.</p>
<p>Bearing all the above in mind, I cannot in good faith recommend working with DataCamp—as an employee or as a content-creator—unless the entire management (not just the sexual assailant) is held to account and accepts their collective responsibility for this debacle. Trust has to be earned; DataCamp has a long way to go to earning it from me and, more importantly, from the community of instructors on whom DataCamp relies.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Apr. 3rd: One hundred or so of DataCamp's content-creators/instructors (including me) delivered a letter demanding clarity on what happened (spurred on partially by <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-DataCamp-RVW22333166.htm"><em>posts on GlassDoor</em></a>).</li>
<li>Apr. 4th: <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/note-to-our-community"><em>DC published a blog post</em></a> with an "apology."</li>
<li>Apr. 5th: <a href="https://blog.rladies.org/post/statement-about-datacamp/"><em>The R-Ladies responded with their ideas.</em></a></li>
<li>Apr. 5th: The target of the sexual assault came forward.</li>
<li>Apr. 8th: <a href="https://medium.com/@heathernolis/on-datacamp-aafd82f94e60"><em>Very thoughtful pieces started to come out.</em></a></li>
<li>Apr. 12th: The HTML from DataCamp’s original “apology” was dissected <a href="https://rud.is/b/2019/04/12/a-note-to-our-community-on-how-to-hide-your-content-from-search-engines/"><em>revealing DataCamp’s deliberate attempt to bury &amp; obscure their post</em></a>.</li>
<li>Apr. 12th: <a href="https://noamross.github.io/datacamp-sexual-assault/"><em>DataCamp’s content creators began asking for a boycott</em></a> of their own courses (nobly depriving themselves of revenue) until DataCamp restores their trust.</li>
<li>Apr. 12th: <a href="https://twitter.com/hrbrmstr/status/1116676406417686529"><em>Tweets addressed to the VC funders of DataCamp</em></a> started to appear asking for their stand on this situation.</li>
<li>Apr. 14th <a href="https://twitter.com/CMastication/status/1117238594090016769"><em>Tweets addressed to DataCamp CEO Jonathan Cornellison</em></a> started to appear asking for his stand on this situation.</li>
